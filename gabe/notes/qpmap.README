step 1:
     arrange data with mzXML files, a heavy_folder containing heavy data, and a light_folder containing light data
     run hlmcombine to copy heavy, light, and mzXML data into a new folder called CimageR_data:

     	 hlmcombine -h my_heavy_folder -l my_light_folder

step 2:
     run a shell-script that executes

     	 cimage silac phospep_1

     in each dta folder 

step 3:
     run fixbadpeps to replace 0-ratios and bad r2s with ratios based on spectral-counts
     this will create a fixed_output.to_excel.txt file in each output/ folder that contains
     'corrected' ratios for un-quantifiable peptides based on spectral-counting

     	 fixbadpeps

step 4:
     run qpmapper to generate a qpmap file

     	 qpmapper

step 5 (optional, recommended):
     run qp_combine to generate a file called 'qp_combined_pnglocs.txt' that contains all of the information
     needed for the PROTOMAP website to display the raw chromatogram files (PNGs) that reside on janus.
     qp_combine uses the qpamp.params file to get folder-names, etc

     	 qp_combine
     
     note: for this to work the permissions for all of these files must be world-readable so:

     	 chmod -R 755 *
